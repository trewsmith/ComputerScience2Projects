# Computer Science Class Projects
This is a collection of some of the projects and assignments I've been able to do for my computer science classes in high school.
It includes projects from Introduction to Computer Science, which covered topics such as circuits, logic gates, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Scratch, and more. 
It also includes projects from Computer Science 1, which was a theory-based class in Python. 
Lastly, they include projects from Computer Science 2 - Data Structures and Algorithms, which was a class based in Java. 
I will be taking AP Computer Science A(Java) starting September 2024 and will be uploading projects from that class as well.
